- Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?

  The application I developed was a weight tracking app, which I called "Weightly" since the user is able to track their weight daily. The app's goal is to make it easy for users to track, edit, and delete their weight. The user can also set a goal weight and enable SMS notifications that are supposed to congratulate the user for getting to their goal.
  
- What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?

  I sadly had to change up a bunch of my designs since they weren't practical due to either errors or space difficulties on Android Studio. The screens necessary were a login, a dashboard, a screen for adding weight, an edit/delete screen, and user settings. The design overall I believe helped the user feel less overwhelmed since I kept it simple. I feel the color scheme also helped since it was "eye-catching" and gave an "energetic" vibe.

  
- How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those be applied in the future?

  My approach started with diagrams. The diagrams I created helped me visualize the app better since I was able to plan out what components I needed to add. Next, I like to write down all the requirements I need to include in my applications. This especially helped with creating Weightly since there were many things I would've missed if it were not for the requirements being listed. These techniques I believe will help me in the future since they've helped me in this class and previous classes.

  
- How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important and what did it reveal?

  For testing, I tested with different Android Emulators. Testing with different emulator phones helped to show me which phones the app would work on and which ones it wouldn't. The process of testing is so important because it reveals what a user may experience when using the app. 

  
- Considering the full app design and development process, from initial planning to finalization, where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?

  I had to change my design a lot sadly to fit within the time range of when the app was due. The finalization part was where I ran into trouble getting things to make sense and to work right. So, my design had to become simpler for now until I go back and change the app now that I have more time. I found that a simpler design can go a long way and cause less stress in the long run.


- In what specific component from your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?

  I think the database was where I shined. Using SQLite wasn't easy at first and that's why I'm so proud of my app since I was able to get the database to store the weight to work properly. I think this demonstrates to a future employer that I have the skill to overcome a difficult part of app creation.
