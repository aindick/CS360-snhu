- Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?

  The application I developed was a weight tracking app, which I called "Weightly" since the user is able to track their weight daily. The app's goal is to make it easy for users to track, edit, and delete their weight. The user can also set a goal weight and enable SMS notifications that are supposed to congratulate the user for getting to their goal.
  
- What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?

  I sadly had to change up a bunch of my designs since they weren't practical due to either errors or space difficulties on Android Studio. The screens necessary were a login, a dashboard, a screen for adding weight, an edit/delete screen, and user settings. The design overall I believe helped the user feel less overwhelmed since I kept it simple. I feel the color scheme also helped since it was "eye-catching" and gave an "energetic" vibe.

  
- How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those be applied in the future?

  My approach started with diagrams. The diagrams I created helped me to visualize the app better. 

  
- How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important and what did it reveal?

  
- Considering the full app design and development process, from initial planning to finalization, where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?


- In what specific component from your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?
